* ``enabled`` Enable / disable the extension without having to uninstall it. Value can be ``true`` or ``false``.
* ``markdown_attributes`` Class attributes to enable as Markdown. Value must be an array of classes, each containing an array of the attributes you want to render as Markdown. Default value is none, you have to set which ones you want!
